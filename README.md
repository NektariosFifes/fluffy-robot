#### Common Vocabulary
|word | meaning |

|simulation/ stress testing | A simulation is a collection of scenarios that are executed on existing services based on the AsyncAPI. It can be stress testing an application, simulating specific environments, etc.|


#### User stories

|#S1 | Should have | As a user i want to call the app with a cli command passing the required flags and arguments along with optional ones.
|#S2 | Should have | As a user i can view statistics during the test . Number of requests per second warnings and errors based on api responces.
|#S3 | Should have | As a user i want to have a choice to initiate tests based on one or multiple .yaml or .json async-api files.I can also pause , unpause the tests, as a standalone process a local or cloud docker container.
|#S4| Should have| As a user i want to be able to install package from npm in @asyncapi scope.
|#S5| Could have | As a user i can write my own modules/extensions to process response messages and create my own statistics. (?use prexisting senarios e.x ddos attack , query injection?)
|#S6| Should have | As a user, I want to run the simulation completely autonomous using defined scenarios.

#### Developer stories
|id | Prioritization | Description |

|#DS1 | Must Have | Use of eslint and prettier for code formating.

#### Implementation details
|id | Prioritization | Description |
| --- | ----| ---|
|#S1 | 1 | Check if container with provided async-spec file is already running .
|#S3   |  1 | Payload will be generated by the examples in the spec file or randomly generated.

#### Non-functional requirements

1. Test coverage of around 95%.
2. Type definitions for the exposed parts of the application (the modules , functions that will be used by the user for making extensions)
