## ReactGoStat
### In Early Development

Any contribution will be greatly appreciated.

Library for React that aims to visualized realtime statistics.
In a playfull, practical and informative way.

### Guide
```
npm install 
npm start
```
For convenience in packaging all components should be in src/components folder 
as  modules. (must have a index.js at root directory)

The App.tsx is for demonstration purposes any other tests you
might try to add place them in a seperate folder.

I realize that right now this is a not very tidy project
i will fix it tho.
